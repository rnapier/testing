# Product Context: Keychain

## Primary Purpose

This package exists as an example project for a blog series about unit testing strategies. It is not production code but rather a teaching aid designed to demonstrate different approaches to testing. The core focus is on showing how to test systems with very limited mocking, or no mocking at all.

## Problem Statement

The blog series addresses several common testing challenges:

1. **Over-reliance on Mocks**: Many developers default to extensive mocking, which can lead to:
   - Tests that verify mock behavior rather than actual functionality
   - Implementation drift between mocks and production code
   - Brittle tests that break with minor implementation changes

2. **Testing External Dependencies**: How to effectively test code that interacts with system services (like Keychain)
   - Balancing real implementation testing vs. isolation
   - Managing the complexity of testing system interactions

3. **Code Design for Testability**: How architecture choices affect testing approaches
   - The tradeoffs between different design patterns
   - The impact of dependency injection techniques on test quality

## Solution Approach

The Keychain package will evolve through multiple implementations to demonstrate testing tradeoffs:

1. **Direct Implementation**: A simple concrete type tested against the real keychain
   - Shows the challenges of testing against real system services
   - Demonstrates the benefits of testing real behavior

2. **Closure-Based Mocking**: Using a struct of closures for testing
   - Illustrates the code overhead of this approach
   - Shows debugging challenges with closure-heavy code
   - Demonstrates inconsistency risks in implementation
   - Reveals how mocks can drift from production code

3. **Protocol-Based Mocking**: Using protocols for abstraction
   - Shows the code overhead of protocols used only for testing
   - Demonstrates how mock implementations can drift from production code

4. **Focused Extraction**: Extracting only the difficult-to-test code
   - Demonstrates how to isolate just the problematic parts
   - Shows how most code can be tested without mocks
   - Illustrates a balanced approach to testability

## Educational Goals

Developers following this blog series should learn:

1. The tradeoffs between different testing approaches
2. How to minimize mocking while maintaining test quality
3. Techniques for testing code that interacts with system services
4. How to design code that's testable without excessive abstraction
5. Practical strategies for balancing real implementation testing with isolation

## Use Cases

1. **Teaching Aid**
   - Demonstrate testing strategies through concrete examples
   - Show evolution of code design for improved testability

2. **Reference Implementation**
   - Provide working examples of different testing approaches
   - Allow comparison between approaches

3. **Blog Series Support**
   - Illustrate concepts discussed in the blog
   - Provide code samples readers can examine and run

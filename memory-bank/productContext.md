# Product Context: Keychain

## Problem Statement

Applications frequently need to store sensitive information such as:
- API keys and tokens
- User credentials
- Encryption keys
- Session identifiers

Storing this data securely while maintaining good performance presents challenges:
1. **Security**: Directly storing sensitive data in UserDefaults or plain files risks exposure
2. **Performance**: Frequent access to the system Keychain is relatively slow
3. **Complexity**: The Keychain Services API is C-based and complex to use directly
4. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access to shared secure storage requires careful management

## Solution

The Keychain package solves these problems by:

1. **Security Layer**: Leveraging Apple's Keychain Services for secure data persistence
2. **Performance Layer**: Implementing an in-memory cache to reduce Keychain access operations
3. **Simplified API**: Providing a clean Swift interface that abstracts away the Keychain complexity
4. **Thread Safety**: Ensuring thread-safe operations through synchronization mechanisms (Mutex)

## User Experience Goals

Developers using this package should:
1. Store and retrieve sensitive data with minimal code
2. Trust in the security of the stored information
3. Experience good performance even with frequent data access
4. Not worry about thread-safety concerns when using the API from multiple threads

## Use Cases

1. **API Authentication**
   - Store API keys and tokens securely
   - Retrieve tokens quickly without repeated Keychain access

2. **User Authentication**
   - Save user credentials securely
   - Check authentication status efficiently

3. **Secure Configuration**
   - Store application configuration securely
   - Access configuration values with good performance

4. **Secure Data Caching**
   - Cache sensitive data in memory for quick access
   - Persist to Keychain for long-term storage

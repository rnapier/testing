# Technical Context: Keychain

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **Swift**: Primary programming language (Swift 6.1)
- **Swift Package Manager**: Dependency management and project structure
- **Keychain Services API**: Apple's secure storage mechanism
- **Synchronization Framework**: For thread safety mechanisms

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **Foundation**: Core functionality and data types
- **Security**: For Keychain Services API access
- **Synchronization**: For Mutex and thread-safety tools

## Development Setup

### Project Structure

```

### Build Requirements
- Swift 6.1+
- iOS 18.0+, macOS 15.0+, tvOS 18.0+, watchOS 11.0+

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Constraints
- Limited to Apple platforms that support Keychain Services
- Must be compatible with Swift concurrency model
- Must respect memory limitations on all targeted platforms

### Security Constraints
- No sensitive data should be logged
- Cached data lives only in memory, not persisted outside Keychain
- Implementation must follow Apple's security best practices

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- None (self-contained package)

### System Dependencies
- Security.framework (Keychain Services)
- Synchronization.framework (Thread safety)

## Technical Decisions

### Dictionary-based In-Memory Cache
- Provides O(1) lookup time for cached values
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Efficient for typical use cases with string keys

### Mutex for Thread Safety
- `Mutex` used for:
  - Direct protection of the dictionary state
  - Modern Swift API design with `.withLock` pattern
  - Thread-safe access with improved ergonomics
  - Strong type safety through generic parameter

### Direct Keychain Services API Usage
- Using the C API directly rather than higher-level abstractions to:
  - Maintain complete control over operations
  - Avoid additional dependencies
  - Ensure optimal performance

### Reset Methods Omission
- `reset()` and `hardReset()` methods not implemented in `KeychainEngine`
  - Provides better security boundaries
  - Prevents accidental data loss
  - Limits scope of responsibility

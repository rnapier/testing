# Active Context: Keychain

## Current Work Focus

We are currently focused on implementing the `KeychainEngine` class which will:
1. Interface with the iOS/macOS Keychain for persistent storage
2. Cache all data in a local `[String:Data]` dictionary
3. Ensure thread-safety using Mutex
4. Implement the core data storage and retrieval methods, excluding reset functionality

## Recent Changes

1. Created the initial `KeychainEngine` class structure
2. Updated the class to be declared as `final` to properly conform to `Sendable`
3. Implemented thread-safe caching using Mutex
4. Implemented data(forKey:), set(_:forKey:), and removeData(forKey:) methods
5. Updated Package.swift to include minimum platform versions for Mutex support

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Implementation**:
   - Add proper imports (Foundation, Security, Synchronization)
   - Implement the Mutex-protected dictionary cache
   - Add the Keychain interaction code for persistence
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Testing**:
   - Create test cases for the KeychainEngine class
   - Verify thread-safety with concurrent operations
   - Test integration with the main Keychain struct

3. **Documentation**:
   - Add inline documentation to explain the implementation details
   - Document any security considerations

## Active Decisions

1. **Thread Safety Approach**: Using Mutex for thread-safe access to the cache dictionary
   - Selected over actor-based approach due to synchronous API requirements
   - Using the preferred `.withLock` pattern for all access to the protected dictionary
   - Added platform requirements to support Mutex (macOS 15.0+, iOS 18.0+)

2. **Cache Implementation**: Using a dictionary directly protected by Mutex
   - Simple but effective for the use case
   - Provides O(1) lookup time for keys

3. **Keychain Interaction**: Direct use of Security framework APIs
   - More control over the exact behavior
   - No additional dependencies required

4. **Method Omissions**: Not implementing `reset()` and `hardReset()` methods as specified
   - Limiting functionality to core operations

## Implementation Patterns and Preferences

1. **Swift API Design**:
   - Public methods expose a clean, intuitive interface
   - Implementation details kept private

2. **Thread Safety Pattern**:
   - Read from cache first, then from Keychain if needed
   - Protected mutation of shared state using Mutex

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Silent failure with returns of nil for data retrieval issues
   - No throwing API to maintain simplicity

## Learnings and Insights

1. **Mutex Usage**: The `Mutex` type takes a generic value and provides thread-safe access through the `withLock` method

2. **Sendable Conformance**: Class types must be marked as `final` to conform to the `Sendable` protocol directly

3. **Cache Strategy**: For this use case, a simple dictionary-based cache provides the best balance of simplicity and performance

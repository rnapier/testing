# Active Context: Keychain

## Current Work Focus

We are currently working with two main components:

1. **Keychain**: A class (currently being used despite the project plan calling for a struct) that:
   - Interfaces directly with Apple's Keychain services
   - Maintains an in-memory cache using a dictionary
   - Uses NSLock for thread safety
   - Has a comprehensive feature set including reset functionality

2. **Next Implementation Phase**: 
   - Refactoring to align with the original architecture plan
   - Converting the current implementation to match the planned architecture
   - Ensuring proper thread safety with modern approaches (Mutex)

## Recent Changes

1. Examined the current Keychain implementation
2. Identified discrepancies between current implementation and planned architecture
3. Updated Package.swift with minimum platform versions for modern API support

## Next Steps

1. **Refactoring Plan**:
   - Implement the `KeychainEngine` class as described in the system patterns
   - Create the `Keychain` struct that uses dependency injection (different from current class implementation)
   - Migrate from NSLock to Mutex for thread-safety
   - Ensure clean separation of concerns between API and implementation layers

2. **Testing**:
   - Create test cases for both the new `KeychainEngine` class and `Keychain` struct
   - Verify thread-safety with concurrent operations
   - Test integration between the components

3. **Documentation**:
   - Add inline documentation to explain the implementation details
   - Document any security considerations
   - Update memory bank with implementation decisions

## Active Decisions

1. **Architecture Alignment**: The current implementation differs from our planned architecture:
   - Current: Single `Keychain` class handling both API and implementation
   - Planned: `Keychain` struct (API) + `KeychainEngine` class (implementation)

2. **Thread Safety Evolution**: 
   - Current: Using NSLock with manual lock/unlock pattern
   - Planned: Using Mutex with `.withLock` pattern for better safety and ergonomics

3. **Reset Functionality**:
   - Current: Implements both `reset()` and `hardReset()` methods
   - Planned: Originally decided to omit these methods, but may need to reconsider

4. **API Surface**:
   - Current: Uses subscripts extensively for different data types
   - Planned: Cleaner, more explicit method-based API

## Implementation Patterns and Preferences

1. **Swift API Design**:
   - Public methods should expose a clean, intuitive interface
   - Implementation details kept private
   - Prefer explicit methods over subscripts for clarity

2. **Thread Safety Pattern**:
   - Read from cache first, then from Keychain if needed
   - Protected mutation of shared state using modern synchronization tools

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Current: Mostly silent failures with some print statements
   - Planned: More consistent approach with proper nil returns or errors

## Learnings and Insights

1. **Implementation Gap**: There is a significant difference between the current implementation and planned architecture.

2. **Mutex Benefits**: Modern `Mutex` type provides better safety guarantees and ergonomics compared to manual NSLock usage.

3. **API Design Considerations**: The current implementation's use of subscripts with different generic types creates a convenient but potentially confusing API.

4. **Reset Functionality**: The current implementation's approach to reset functionality (with persisting keys) demonstrates a thoughtful approach to secure data management.

5. **Thread Safety Patterns**: The current implementation uses a concurrent dispatch queue with barriers for write operations, showing another valid approach to thread safety.

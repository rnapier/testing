# Active Context: Keychain

## Current Work Focus

We are currently working with a teaching-focused project that demonstrates different testing approaches:

1. **Keychain Implementation (Stage 1)**: A concrete class that:
   - Interfaces directly with Apple's Keychain services
   - Maintains an in-memory cache using a dictionary
   - Uses NSLock for thread safety
   - Has a comprehensive feature set including reset functionality
   - Is tested directly against the real keychain

2. **Blog Series Development**: 
   - Developing a series of implementations to demonstrate testing tradeoffs
   - Currently in Stage 1 (direct implementation)
   - Planning for Stage 2 (closure-based mocking)
   - Planning for Stage 3 (protocol-based mocking)
   - Planning for Stage 4 (focused extraction)

## Recent Changes

1. Clarified the project's purpose as a teaching aid for testing strategies
2. Documented the planned evolution through different testing approaches
3. Updated memory bank to reflect the educational focus of the project

## Next Steps

1. **Stage 1 Documentation**:
   - Document the current direct implementation approach
   - Highlight the benefits and drawbacks of testing against real system services
   - Prepare for transition to Stage 2

2. **Stage 2 Planning**:
   - Design the closure-based mocking implementation
   - Prepare examples that demonstrate:
     - The heavy code overhead of this approach
     - Debugging challenges with closure-heavy code
     - Inconsistent implementation risks
     - How mocks can drift from production code

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Document current testing approach (direct testing)
   - Plan tests for future implementations
   - Ensure tests demonstrate the tradeoffs of each approach

## Active Decisions

1. **Educational Focus**: The project's primary purpose is to demonstrate testing approaches:
   - Architecture will intentionally change multiple times
   - Each implementation will highlight specific testing tradeoffs
   - Code clarity is prioritized over production-level optimizations

2. **Testing Evolution**: 
   - Current: Direct testing against the real keychain
   - Planned: Progress through increasingly sophisticated testing approaches
   - Goal: Demonstrate the tradeoffs of each approach

3. **Reset Functionality**:
   - Current: Implements both `reset()` and `hardReset()` methods
   - These methods are particularly useful for testing cleanup

4. **API Surface**:
   - Current: Uses subscripts extensively for different data types
   - Each implementation stage may use different API designs to highlight testing implications

## Implementation Patterns and Preferences

1. **Testing First Design**:
   - Each implementation is designed to highlight specific testing approaches
   - Code structure serves the educational purpose of demonstrating testing tradeoffs

2. **Thread Safety Pattern**:
   - Read from cache first, then from Keychain if needed
   - Protected mutation of shared state using synchronization tools
   - Thread safety is maintained across all implementations

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Current: Mostly silent failures with some print statements
   - Each implementation may handle errors differently to demonstrate testing implications

## Learnings and Insights

1. **Testing Tradeoffs**: The project demonstrates that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to testing.

2. **Mock Limitations**: The planned implementations will show how mocks can drift from production code, potentially leading to false confidence in tests.

3. **API Design Considerations**: The current implementation's use of subscripts with different generic types creates a convenient but potentially confusing API.

4. **Reset Functionality**: The current implementation's approach to reset functionality (with persisting keys) demonstrates a thoughtful approach to secure data management.

5. **Educational Value**: The project's value lies in its evolution through different approaches, allowing developers to compare and contrast testing strategies.

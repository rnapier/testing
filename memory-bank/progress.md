# Project Progress: Keychain

## What Works

- ✅ Project structure is set up as a Swift package
- ✅ `Keychain` class is implemented with:
  - ✅ Thread-safe cache implementation using NSLock
  - ✅ iOS Keychain integration for data persistence
  - ✅ Methods for various data types (String, Data, Bool)
  - ✅ Subscript-based access for different types
  - ✅ Reset and hardReset functionality
  - ✅ Dictionary-based cache for performance
- ✅ Package.swift updated with required minimum platform versions

## What's Left to Build

- ⬜ Architecture Refactoring:
  - ⬜ Implement `KeychainEngine` class per system design
  - ⬜ Create `Keychain` struct with dependency injection
  - ⬜ Migrate from NSLock to Mutex for thread safety
  - ⬜ Implement cleaner method-based API

- ⬜ Testing:
  - ⬜ Unit tests for both components
  - ⬜ Concurrency tests for thread safety
  - ⬜ Integration tests between components

- ⬜ Documentation:
  - ⬜ Add code documentation comments
  - ⬜ Create usage examples
  - ⬜ Document security best practices

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Project Setup | ✅ Complete | Swift Package with basic structure |
| Original Keychain class | ✅ Complete | Full implementation but not matching planned architecture |
| Keychain struct (planned) | ⬜ Not Started | Needs to be created to match system design |
| KeychainEngine class | ⬜ Not Started | Needs to be created to match system design |
| Tests | ⬜ Not Started | Will be created after implementation |
| Documentation | ⬜ Not Started | Will be created after implementation |

## Known Issues

- Implementation doesn't match planned architecture
- Using NSLock instead of planned Mutex approach
- Reset functionality included despite being listed as excluded in requirements

## Evolution of Decisions

### Architecture Reality
- Started with a direct implementation that combines API and implementation
- Need to refactor to match the planned architecture with separate API and implementation layers

### Thread Safety Approach
- Current: NSLock with manual lock/unlock
- Planned: Mutex with .withLock pattern
- Package.swift updated with platform requirements to support Mutex

### Method Implementation
- Current: Includes reset() and hardReset() methods
- Planned: Originally decided to omit these methods, but may need to reconsider

# Project Progress: Keychain

## What Works

- ✅ Project structure is set up as a Swift package
- ✅ `Keychain` struct is implemented with dependency injection pattern
- ✅ `KeychainEngine` class has been implemented with:
  - ✅ Thread-safe cache implementation using Mutex
  - ✅ iOS Keychain integration for data persistence
  - ✅ data(forKey:) method with cache + Keychain lookup
  - ✅ set(_:forKey:) method with cache + Keychain updates
  - ✅ removeData(forKey:) method for data removal
- ✅ Package.swift updated with required minimum platform versions

## What's Left to Build

- ⬜ Testing:
  - ⬜ Unit tests for KeychainEngine functionality
  - ⬜ Concurrency tests for thread safety
  - ⬜ Integration tests with Keychain struct

- ⬜ Documentation:
  - ⬜ Add code documentation comments
  - ⬜ Create usage examples
  - ⬜ Document security best practices

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Project Setup | ✅ Complete | Swift Package with basic structure |
| Keychain struct | ✅ Complete | API interface with dependency injection |
| KeychainEngine class | ✅ Complete | Implemented with thread-safe cache and Keychain integration |
| Tests | ⬜ Not Started | Will be created after implementation |
| Documentation | ⬜ Not Started | Will be created after implementation |

## Known Issues

- No current implementation issues identified

## Evolution of Decisions

### Class Structure
- Started with a basic class implementation
- Updated to final class to conform to Sendable protocol

### Thread Safety Approach
- Initial consideration of actor-based approach 
- Changed to NSLock-based approach as an intermediary solution
- Finally implemented Mutex as specified and preferred
- Updated Package.swift with platform requirements to support Mutex

### Method Implementation
- Decision to not implement reset() and hardReset() methods as specified in requirements

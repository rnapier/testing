# Project Progress: Keychain

## What Works

- ✅ Project structure is set up as a Swift package
- ✅ Stage 1 (Direct Implementation):
  - ✅ `Keychain` class is implemented with:
    - ✅ Thread-safe cache implementation using NSLock
    - ✅ iOS Keychain integration for data persistence
    - ✅ Methods for various data types (String, Data, Bool)
    - ✅ Subscript-based access for different types
    - ✅ Reset and hardReset functionality
    - ✅ Dictionary-based cache for performance
  - ✅ Basic tests implemented against real keychain
- ✅ Project purpose clarified as a teaching aid for testing strategies
- ✅ Memory bank updated to reflect educational focus

## What's Left to Build

- ⬜ Stage 1 (Direct Implementation):
  - ⬜ Additional documentation of current approach
  - ⬜ Analysis of testing tradeoffs with direct implementation

- ⬜ Stage 2 (Closure-Based Mocking):
  - ⬜ Refactor to use closure-based dependency injection
  - ⬜ Implement tests with mock closures
  - ⬜ Document overhead and challenges of this approach

- ⬜ Stage 3 (Protocol-Based Mocking):
  - ⬜ Define protocol for keychain operations
  - ⬜ Implement concrete and mock implementations
  - ⬜ Document protocol overhead and implementation drift issues

- ⬜ Stage 4 (Focused Extraction):
  - ⬜ Extract minimal KeychainStorage class for system interaction
  - ⬜ Keep business logic in testable, non-mocked code
  - ⬜ Document benefits of minimal mocking approach

- ⬜ Blog Series Content:
  - ⬜ Document each implementation stage
  - ⬜ Compare and contrast testing approaches
  - ⬜ Provide guidance on when each approach is appropriate

| Stage 4: Focused Extraction | ⬜ Not Started | Planned final implementation |
| Blog Series Content | ⬜ In Progress | Documenting testing approaches |

## Known Issues

- None - the current implementation is intentionally designed as Stage 1 of the teaching progression

## Evolution of Decisions

### Educational Focus
- Clarified that the project's primary purpose is to demonstrate testing approaches
- Each implementation stage will intentionally use different architectural patterns
- The evolution of the code is a feature, not a bug, as it demonstrates different testing tradeoffs

### Testing Approach Evolution
- Stage 1: Direct testing against real system services
  - Pros: Tests real behavior, no abstraction overhead
  - Cons: Tests depend on system keychain, potential for flakiness

- Stage 2: Closure-based mocking (planned)
  - Will demonstrate heavy code overhead and debugging challenges

- Stage 3: Protocol-based mocking (planned)
  - Will demonstrate protocol overhead and implementation drift issues

- Stage 4: Focused extraction (planned)
  - Will demonstrate minimal mocking approach with best balance

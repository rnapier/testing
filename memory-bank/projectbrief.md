# Project Brief: Keychain

## Purpose

A Swift package for securely storing sensitive data using iOS/macOS keychain with an in-memory cache layer for performance optimization.

## Core Requirements

1. **Secure Storage**: Interface with Apple's Keychain services for secure data persistence
2. **Performance Optimization**: Maintain an in-memory cache of stored values to reduce Keychain access operations
3. **Thread Safety**: Ensure thread-safe operations using synchronization mechanisms
4. **Simple API**: Provide a clean, intuitive API for storing and retrieving data
5. **Swift Package**: Structured as a Swift Package Manager compatible library

## Project Scope

The Keychain package provides a mechanism to:
- Store data securely in the system Keychain
- Retrieve previously stored data
- Remove specific data entries
- Maintain a thread-safe cache for performance

## Core Components

1. **Keychain**: A struct providing a dependency-injection approach to keychain operations
2. **KeychainEngine**: A class implementing the actual Keychain interaction and caching logic

## Non-Requirements

- Complex data structure storage (limited to basic Data types)
- User interface components
- Encryption/decryption algorithms (relies on the system Keychain)
